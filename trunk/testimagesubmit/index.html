      <h1>Check Image Upload Test</h1>
      <h3>Please chose which test you want:</h3>
      <a href="syncupload">Synchronous check image upload</a>
      <br/>
      This test submits the user-entered data and the check image all together in one
      request. This is the simplest implementation.
      <br/><br/>
      <a href="asyncupload">Asynchronous check image upload</a>
      <br/>
      This test uploads the check images as soon as they are captured. The server gives 
      back a handle for each image uploaded. This handle is inserted into the form submitted
      later with the user-entered data when the user actually submits. If the uploading is
      still going on, the page waits until the upload is completely done. This is more complex 
      and requires some server/client coordination.
      <br/><br/>
      <a href="parallelupload">Parallel check image upload</a>
      <br/>
      This test uploads the check images in parallel when the user clicks submit. Server gives
      back a handle for each image uploaded. The handle is inserted into the form being submitted.
      The actual submit waits until both images are properly loaded then the user-entered data
      and the handles are submitted. This is as complex and requires some server/client coordination
      as the asynchronouse check upload.
